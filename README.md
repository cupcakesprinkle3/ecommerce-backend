# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Project Motivation
This is challenge 13 in the UC Berekely Full Stack Dev Bootcamp. In this challenge we are to build the backend for an ecommerce site. We'll create the database models (category, product, tag, and product tags), associations between them, and fill out the API routes to perform CRUD operations.

## Tech Used
Starter code from the bootcamp, and Express.js, Sequelize, and MySQL.

## Walkthrough Video
Coming soon

## More Commits on Former Repo
I had some trouble pushing to git when I reverted some of the files to the starter code in an attempt to get the Product and Tag models and routes working. Error message was: 
```
  ERROR: Permission to coding-boot-camp/fantastic-umbrella.git denied to cupcakesprinkle3.
  fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

  Please make sure you have the correct access rights
  and the repository exists. 
```
To workaround this issue, I renamed my old repo to old-ecommerce-backend, created a new repo called ecommerce-backend. As a result there are fewer commits to this repo than the total number for the whole challenge. You can find additional commits to this project on the old repo: https://github.com/cupcakesprinkle3/old-ecommerce-backend
